you try the door and after a big push it budges swings open 

you are almost pushed back inside by a huge gust of wind as snow blows in your face you look on at the landscape before you as your eyes ajust to the light its a prety much flat snow coverd tundra but there is a small moutian in the distance 

you look at the moutian and decied it would be best to head over there but right as you take your first steps some movement catches you eye and when you look over you see a person in a coat heading off somewhere 

[ignore the stranger and head twords the moutians](2)

[follow the stranger stealthily](3)
