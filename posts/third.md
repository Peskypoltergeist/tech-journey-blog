fliping your eyes open you look around your in a dark room and cant see a thing and even worse you have no memory of how you got in this situation... or much of any memory at all

exploring the room only leaves you with more questions then answers it seems to be made of metal and the air is very cold and dry 

after a little bit longer of feeling around thankfuly you find what feals to be a match you light it and it fills the room with light 

the room looks like a camper van almost but completly made of iron in its very dusty and there are many cobwebs there is also a bunkbed some cabnets and what looks to be a small kitchen there is also a large door that you can now see

what do you want to do next?
