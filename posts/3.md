your curisoity gets the better of you and you walk after the stranger trying not to make a sound until your close enough to get a good look at them 

she apears to be a woman she has long red hair and pierceing yellow eyes with freckles all over her pale face and what apears to be a scar on her left check 

dispite beaing out in what amounts to prety much a flat slate of snow you manage avoid the girl's atention as you follow her to wherever her destination is 

but your sudently caught off gaurd by a growl behind you

you look behind you to see a very large wolf snarling and before you can even think it lunges at your leg and bites your leg and you screem surly catching the atention of the girl you pass out at the sight of your own blood but right before you do you here the loading of a rifel and a gunshot 

next thing you know you wake up in some kind of tent on a bed the red headed girl from earlier is sitting nearby asleep in a chair
