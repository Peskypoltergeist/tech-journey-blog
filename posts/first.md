looking around only makes the situation more concerning you check the cabnets only to find them mostly empty but some are filed with broken vials of strange liquids and medical suplys you shrug it off and decied its best not to drink any of them

you look around a bit more before your face goes cold and you see something that makes your skin crawl there is a human skeleton in the corner coverd in cobwebs it apears to have been there for quite a long time but even still it gives you an uneasy fealing ...almost like you could be next

[look at the skeleton](skel1)

[try the door](1)
