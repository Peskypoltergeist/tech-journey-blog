you continue looking around you walk over to a fire pit and notice there are a stack of papers at the fire place they seem to have some kind of construction plans 

'i dont want these to get burnt' you think to yourself so you move them 

you walk over to the person and pear over thier sholder they are hapily carving a little bird into a chunk of wood well humming something to themself

[talk to the person](creep1)
