you look around the tent a bit it apears to be made out of some sort of animal hide heald up by some wood polls with intricate paterns on them orther then that there is a bed that you are curently laying on a chair that the girl is in a table and a small fire place you 

decide to get off of the bed to get a closer look at the wood carveings but when you doa pain instanly shoots through your leg you look down to see that it has been bandaged up and a bit but it bleeds through you get a little woozy at the blood and stumble a bit before quickly look back up to see the girl now awake looking back at you

"oh gosh- i should give you this before you hurt yourself even more"

(she grabs your leg and it takes you by surpries seems a bit bold for a stranger but she seams to be trying to help so you dont stop her)
(she puts a brace on your leg and hands you a krutch)
