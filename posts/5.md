you look around the tent a bit it apears to be made out of some sort of animal hide heald up by some wood polls with intricate paterns on them orther then that there is a bed that you are curently laying on a chair that the girl is in a table and a small fire place you 

you get off the bed to get a better view of the room but pain shoots through your leg and you stumble to the floor you look back up to see the girl now awake looking back at you

"oh gosh- i should give you this before you hurt yourself even more"

(she grabs your leg it seems a bit bold for a stranger but she seams to be trying to help so you dont stop her)
she puts a brace on your leg and hands you a krutch

"here that should get you off your feet!- oh sorry i bet your pretty confused especially after getting attacked like that"
